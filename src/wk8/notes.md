# Fun Application
## Working with Geometry

Allow the user to create shapes
Which Shapes?
- Square
- Rectangle
- Other comomon 2D shapes

Allow the user to calcuate and see a text-based drawing of the shape

____________________________

Base Class
Other shapes derive from Base Class

- A class that is a dedicated Superclass
    - Abstract class
        - has all features of concrete class
            - but cannot be instantiated
        - abstract methods
            -method that has no default implementation

Interface
    a list/outline of requirements
        - outline a list of things that NEED to be implemented
    - only outline actions4

______________________________________

Drawable: interface
    - draw(): declaration of method

Shape: abstract
    - name: String
    - getName(), setName(): concrete/regular methods
    - area(): abstract method
    - perimeter(): abstract method

Rectangle
    - length: int
    - width: int
    - name: from Shape
    - area(), perimeter() from Shape
    - draw() from Drawable: 
Triangle
    - base, height: int
    - area(), perimeter() from Shape
    - draw() from Drawable: 

____________________

Create the Triangle Class
Bonus: Create the circle



base 10
height 3


___________________________

You are to create the following ecosystem
- Character 
- FastCharacter, PowerfulCharacter, StrongCharacter
- Boss
- HumanBeing

- Each character has a name, speed, health & power
- A boss has an extra characteristic that isn't found in any regular character
- A FastCharacter has high speed value
- A PowerfulCharacter has high power value
- A StrongCharacter has high health value

- All instantiable entities must have
    - an intro phrase: ex "Hi there"
    - an outro phrase: ex "See you next time"
    - an action when they're created/born
    - an action when they've perished/ beaten
